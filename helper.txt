todos
* Rename to "keptn-pitometer-ui" -> also add keptn logo in UI
* mongoose -> ORM Mapper
* Move from Collection per Context to "Single Collection" with Key on Context
* implement "data only indicators" -> these are indicators that are not graded!
* implement "always fail" indicators -> indicators that when violating the thresholds will fail the build!

Ideas
* Mark a testrun as "Baseline Run" -> "Flag" individual test runs with a status, e.g: "ingore", "baseline", "xyz"
* Generate Report of specific Test Run + Compare Test Run! -> extend HTTP parameters for /report 
* Provide a Webhook to Pitometer that gets called when Pitometer run is finished!
* Schedule Pitometer Runs to execute e.g: every 30s and use it for alerting -> hence the Webhook option!
