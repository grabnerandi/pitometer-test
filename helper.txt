todos
* extract report to pitometer-test
* pitometer-test becomes pitometer-reportsample
* mongoose -> ORM Mapper
* Move from Collection per Context to "Single Collection" with Key on Context

* provide example queries for "compare"
* provide "test context" as input field

Ideas
* Mark a testrun as "Baseline Run" -> "Flag" individual test runs with a status, e.g: "ingore", "baseline", "xyz"
* Generate Report of specific Test Run + Compare Test Run! -> extend HTTP parameters for /report
